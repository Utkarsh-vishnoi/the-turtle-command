# the-turtle-command
I used bootstrap library to design the front-end. The logic is written in javascript, and used jquery for easier access.
The grid was designed on canvas. 

The core problem has been solved.

# Future Improvements
Add color to the console.
Add help page.
Show co-ordinate on hover over the grid.
Navigate the turtle through the keyboard
Implement images of turtle and obstacles instead of circles.
